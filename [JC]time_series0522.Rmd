# Time Series Data

* data collected at different points in time(day1, day2, day3, day7......)

* some characteristics

  + potential for correlation between observations
  
  + regularly repeating pattern

# Diffusion Map

* dimensionality reduction/feature extraction algorithm

* coordinates can be computed from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a diffusion operator on the data(non-linear version of PCA)

# Diffusion Map: non-linear version of PCA

.pull-right[

* picked first few eigenvectors and eigenvalues

* computed coordinates from them

* projected to those coordinates

-> robust to noise perturbation

# Diffusion Map

* dimensionality reduction/feature extraction algorithm

* coordinates can be computed from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a diffusion operator on the data(non-linear version of PCA)

* the Euclidean distance between points in the embedded space is equal to the "diffusion distance" between probability distributions centered at those points

```

.pull-right[
* running the chain forward in time geometric structure at larger and larger scales (the diffusion process)

* the notion of a cluster in the data set is quantified as a region in which the probability of escaping this region is low (within a certain time t)

* taking into account all linking between points, describing a global picture

* coordinates can be computed from the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a diffusion operator on the data(non-linear version of PCA)

* the Euclidean distance between points in the embedded space is equal to the "diffusion distance" between probability distributions centered at those points

* advantages:

  + robust to noise perturbation
  
  + emphasizing the concept of a cluster
  
  + computationally inexpensive

# Haghverdi 2016[2]: Model Design

* use Gaussians kernel to build the transition matrix

* use discrete random walks and graph searches to approximate the continuous process of diffusion

# Farrell 2018[5]: Model Design

* use k-nearest-neighbor graph to build the transition matrix

*"the walks are biased to only transitionto cells of equal or earlier pseudotime so thatwhen they reach developmental branch points,they proceed toward the root and do not explore other cell types"*

# Some Random Thoughts

* add pesudo-correlation within cells between different time point

* combine with RNA velocity -> a new embedded space
